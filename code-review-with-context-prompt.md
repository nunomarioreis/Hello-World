### Step 6 — Summary review saving
A unique review summary should be updated in the existing <REVIEW_FILE_PATH/> after the issues object.
The review should be a short summary, about 1 to 3 sentences but unique for all changes, with this format:

```json
{
  "summary": "Add a short summary of the review, about 1 to 3 sentences but unique for all changes"
}
```
Do not add more than one summary to the file.
